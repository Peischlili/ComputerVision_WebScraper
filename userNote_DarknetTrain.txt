	pretrained_weight / latest weight if use custom dataset
	obj.data => path of all config files, no need to change
	obj.names => names of classes in order from index 0, no need to change
	train.txt => relative path of train images to darknet executable
	test.txt => relative path of test images to darknet executable
	yolo-obj.cfg => parameter file, make sure to modify before executing
 
- obj:
	all resized images: image.jpg
	all image annotations: image.txt

/obj, train.txt and test.txt could be generated by pre-processing notebook in Yolo3/Yolo3_imageProcessing.ipynb

Examples of configuration files could be found in Yolo3/obj.cfg
